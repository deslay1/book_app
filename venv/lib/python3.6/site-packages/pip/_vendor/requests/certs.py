~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle. There is
only one — the one from the certifi package.

If SellerOrBuyeru are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
environment, SellerOrBuyeru can change the definition of where() to return a separately
packaged CA bundle.
